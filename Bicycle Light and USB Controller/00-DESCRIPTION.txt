LED lights, USB charger (for phone) and generator (dynamo) controler for bicycle. 
In program you can charge current and voltage value for your requirements.
Device oportunities:
-boost converter (100kHz) to convert li-ion battery to USB phone charger.
-OLED display (128x32) to show mode (USB, LED, Common, OFF)
-switch to select mode
-current in led and usb depending from dynamo and battery state
-2 current sensor (via low side resistor)
-uC STM32G030F6P6 on board (older version was Bluepill STM32F103C8T6, oldest without uC)

Future plans:
-new switch function (long click)
-new screen
