Attiny13 Boost Converter - parameters:
-supply by 5V (e.g. USB) or 3,7 (Li-ion), any voltage supported by Attiny13 is acceptable
-two code solutions (with and without PID)
-PID need more memory, but is better under current load
-default output voltage is set by code and potentiometer
-KiCAD files include PCB project
-current output is 0,5 A (but is easy to change - need stronger elements)
